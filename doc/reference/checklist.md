# Dapper Debugger — Features Checklist

A compact status matrix for Dapper's Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) features and the near-term roadmap.

Legend
- ✅ Implemented
- 🟡 Partial / in-progress
- ❌ Not implemented

---

## Core Debugging Features

### Program control
- ✅ Launch (start a new Python program under debugger)
- ✅ Attach (attach to running program)
- ✅ Restart
- ✅ Disconnect
- ✅ Terminate

### Execution control
- ✅ Continue
- ✅ Pause
- ✅ Next (step over)
- ✅ Step In
- ✅ Step Out
- ✅ Async-aware stepping — `next`/`stepIn` over `await` skips event-loop internals and lands in user code (asyncio / concurrent.futures frames filtered via `_is_event_loop_frame`); see [Async Debugging reference](../guides/async-debugging.md)
- ❌ Reverse Continue (reverse debugging)
- ✅ Step granularity (instruction-level stepping) — `StepGranularity` enum; `line`/`statement`/`instruction` forwarded end-to-end; `user_opcode` + `f_trace_opcodes` for instruction stepping

---

## Breakpoints

### Source breakpoints
- ✅ Set / remove source breakpoints (line-level, verified/unverified)
- 🟡 Breakpoint conditions (basic condition evaluation supported; more advanced expressions & testing ongoing)
- ✅ Hit conditions (N-th hit / modulo / comparisons; implemented by BreakpointResolver)
- ✅ Log points (formatting & output without stopping; see Breakpoints Controller page)

### Function breakpoints
- ✅ Set function breakpoints (adapter + debug launcher support)
- 🟡 Function breakpoint conditions (resolver supports them; more test coverage is desirable)

### Exception breakpoints
- ✅ Set exception breakpoints (raised/uncaught filters supported)
- 🟡 Exception options / advanced filtering (work in progress)

### Data breakpoints
- 🟡 Data breakpoint requests & bookkeeping (dataBreakpointInfo, setDataBreakpoints implemented; adapter advertises capability)
- 🟡 Runtime watchpoints (trigger on write/value change/read) — variable and expression watchpoints are supported when watches are registered (including `frame:<id>:expr:<expression>`), and read watchpoints are available on Python 3.12+ via `sys.monitoring` (name-read scope). On older versions, read access types gracefully fall back to write semantics. Broader cross-process/read-precision integration work remains. See [Watchpoints reference](../guides/watchpoints.md).

Reference: see Architecture — [Breakpoints Controller](../architecture/breakpoints.md) for design notes and Phase 1 status.

---

## Runtime introspection

### Threads & frames
- ✅ Threads listing and basic metadata
- ✅ Dynamic thread names (live names read from `threading.enumerate()` at query time)
- ✅ Asyncio task inspector — live `asyncio.Task` objects exposed as pseudo-threads with full coroutine call stacks
- ✅ Stack traces (frames, locations, ids)
- ✅ Source references for non-filesystem sources (runtime source registry: `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, Cython intermediates)

### Variables & scopes
- ✅ Scopes (locals/globals)
- ✅ Variables listing
- ✅ Set variable (support for complex types and conversions)
- ✅ Variable presentation / presentationHint — see [Variable Presentation reference](../guides/variable-presentation.md)

### Expression evaluation
- 🟡 Evaluate expressions in-frame — [Frame Evaluation](../guides/frame-eval.md) backend; partial support
- 🟡 Expression-backed watchpoints via `setDataBreakpoints` (`frame:<id>:expr:<expression>`)
- ✅ Set expression (`setExpression` DAP request)
- ✅ Completions / auto-complete for expression editors

See also: [Frame Eval User Guide](../guides/frame-eval.md).

---

## Advanced features / code navigation
- ✅ Loaded sources listing (what's present in runtime)
- ✅ Source request handling (adapter supports `source` and `moduleSource` requests)
- 🟡 Hot code reload / reload-and-continue (`supportsHotReload`, `dapper/hotReload`, `dapper/hotReloadResult`) — protocol/types, request handler, in-process runtime reload service, frame-local rebinding, and VS Code command/auto-on-save are implemented; external-process runtime support remains. See [Hot Reload reference](../guides/hot-reload.md).
- 🟡 Multi-process child auto-attach (`subprocessAutoAttach`, `dapper/childProcess`, `dapper/childProcessExited`, `dapper/childProcessCandidate`) — Phase 1 + Phase 2 launch-path handling are implemented for Python subprocess script/module/code invocations (including common `multiprocessing`/`ProcessPoolExecutor` worker launch shapes) with session correlation and recursion guardrails; process-tree UX and broader runtime matrix hardening remain.
- ❌ Goto targets (find jump targets / navigation helpers — planned)
- ✅ Modules listing
- ❌ Module source retrieval (not fully supported in all backends)

---

## Implementation status — short summary

Dapper provides a stable, functional core debugger experience: program control, stepping, breakpoint management, stack/threads, variables and set-variable operations are implemented and well-tested. Expression completions are implemented. Async/concurrency debugging is fully supported — asyncio tasks appear as pseudo-threads, stepping is async-aware, and thread names are live. Structured variable rendering (dataclasses, namedtuples, Pydantic v1 & v2) is implemented with field-level expansion and presentation hints. Work remains on higher-level ergonomics: advanced breakpoint workflows (runtime watchpoints), source navigation UX, and profiling integration.

---

## Roadmap (near-term)

- Source navigation & goto targets — tests and partial `source` handling exist; goto targets planned
- Runtime watchpoints — bookkeeping and runtime triggers implemented; read-access detection, per-address watches, and cross-process robustness remain
- Hot reload for external-process sessions — in-process path complete; external-process runtime support remains
- Process-tree UX for multi-process attach — Phase 1 + 2 launch-path handling done; tree view and runtime matrix hardening remain
- Reverse debugging / time-travel (future)
- Performance profiling integration (future)
