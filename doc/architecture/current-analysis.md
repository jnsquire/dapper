# Current Analysis

This page is the canonical `Architecture > Analysis` nav target.

## Status

- The architecture baseline is documented in [Architecture Overview](overview.md).
- Message interactions are documented in [Message Flows](message_flows.md).
- Lifecycle details are documented in [Lifecycle Management](lifecycle-management.md).

## Notes

This page is intentionally lightweight and acts as a stable entry point for ongoing architecture analysis updates.
