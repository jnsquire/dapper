# Dapper AI Debugger Examples

This section contains examples showing how to use Dapper in different scenarios. For runnable code and scripts, check the repository's `examples/` directory.

Key example pages and scripts:

- `integrated_debugging.py` — shows how to embed the debugger into an application
- `adapter_in_thread.py` — demonstrates the in-process adapter (adapter runs on a background thread)
- `simple_command_provider.py` — shows a custom session-aware command provider
- `demo_restart.py`, `demo_set_variable.py`, and `demo_enhanced_set_variable.py` — small demos for key features

For more background and usage instructions, see the root examples directory in the repo — this page exists to make those references resolvable from the site.
