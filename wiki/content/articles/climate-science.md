# Climate Science

**Climate science** is the study of Earth's climate system and how it changes over time. Understanding climate science is essential for making informed decisions about our planet's future.

## What Is Climate Change?

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional climate patterns. While Earth's climate has always varied naturally, current changes are primarily driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases.

## The Greenhouse Effect

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms Earth's surface:

1. **Sunlight** reaches Earth's surface
2. **Heat** is absorbed and re-radiated as infrared radiation
3. **Greenhouse gases** in the atmosphere trap some of this heat
4. **Temperature** increases to maintain livable conditions

### Key Greenhouse Gases

- **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)** - From burning fossil fuels, deforestation
- **Methane (CH₄)** - From agriculture, landfills, natural gas
- **Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)** - From fertilizers and industrial processes
- **Water Vapor (H₂O)** - The most abundant, but part of feedback loops

## Evidence of Climate Change

### Temperature Records

- Global average temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial times
- The last decade was the warmest on record
- Arctic temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average

### Physical Indicators

- **Melting ice sheets** - Greenland and Antarctica losing mass
- **Glacier retreat** - Mountain glaciers shrinking worldwide
- **Sea level rise** - Approximately 20cm since 1900, accelerating
- **Ocean warming** - Oceans absorbing 90% of excess heat
- **Ocean acidification** - pH levels decreasing due to CO₂ absorption

### Biological Indicators

- **Species migration** - Animals and plants shifting ranges
- **Earlier spring events** - Earlier flowering, migration, breeding
- **Coral bleaching** - Increased frequency and severity
- **Ecosystem disruption** - Changes in timing and distribution

## Consequences

### Environmental Impacts

- More frequent and intense extreme weather events
- Changes in precipitation patterns
- Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services
- Disruption of natural cycles

### Human Impacts

- Threats to food security and water supply
- Increased health risks from heat and disease
- Economic costs from damage and adaptation
- Displacement of populations

## What Can Be Done?

### Mitigation (Reducing Emissions)

- **Transition to renewable energy** - Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal
- **Improve energy efficiency** - Buildings, transportation, industry
- **Sustainable transportation** - Electric vehicles, public transit
- **Protect and restore forests** - Carbon sequestration
- **Sustainable agriculture** - Reduce emissions from farming

### Adaptation (Preparing for Changes)

- **Infrastructure resilience** - Sea walls, flood defenses
- **Water management** - Drought planning, water conservation
- **Agricultural adaptation** - Drought-resistant crops
- **Emergency preparedness** - Planning for extreme events
- **Ecosystem conservation** - Protecting natural buffers

## Scientific Consensus

The scientific consensus on climate change is overwhelming:

- 97% or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree that humans are causing warming
- Major scientific organizations worldwide support this conclusion
- Evidence comes from multiple independent sources and methods

## Common Misconceptions

- **Myth**: Climate has always changed naturally
  - **Reality**: Current warming is unprecedented in rate and cause
  
- **Myth**: Scientists disagree about climate change
  - **Reality**: 97%+ consensus among climate scientists

- **Myth**: It's too late to do anything
  - **Reality**: Every fraction of a degree matters; action now reduces future harm

## Why It Matters

Climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing humanity. Understanding the science helps us:

- Make informed personal choices
- Support effective policies
- Prepare for unavoidable changes
- Work toward solutions

The decisions we make today will determine the world we leave for future generations.
